# Job Role Prediction (Milestone 1)

This project is part of my Infosys Internship.  
The goal is to predict **job roles from educational background, certifications, and skills** using Machine Learning.

## 📌 Milestone 1
- Completed **data collection** (from Kaggle / synthetic dataset).  
- Performed **data cleaning** (removed nulls, standardized fields).  
- Conducted **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**.  
- Generated a **clean dataset and EDA notebook**.

## 📊 Files in this Repo
- `Infosys(M-1).ipynb` → Jupyter Notebook with data cleaning + EDA.  
- `archive (1).zip` → Dataset used.  
- `README.md` → Project overview.  
- `LICENSE` → MIT License.

## 🛠️ Next Steps
- Milestone 2 → Feature Engineering & Preprocessing  
- Milestone 3 → Model Training & Evaluation (XGBoost)  
- Milestone 4 → Deployment (Streamlit / FastAPI)
